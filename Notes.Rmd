# Introduction

Administrative register data:

 * *administrative* = derived from administrative system
 * *register* = run continuously, full target system
 * *data* = quantitative, rectangular data
 
Examples: population, vital, housing, tax, health, migration registers...


Registers rely on procedures which translate the event or the count into the register data. This evals several steps, filling in forms, sending documents between persons and organisations, writing it into a computer system. This step-wise process has implications for data quality.

### Advantages

1. Size: not just a sample, often large

2. Participation: often compulsory (legally required), sometimes highly incentived

3. Data quality: often no missing values

### Specialities of ARD

* Found data:

    * not collected for research

    * often messy, fragmented, semi-systematic
    
* Big data: often large and complex

### Challenges

* Ethical

  * no informed consent
  
  * misuse of registers

* Legal

  * Data protection laws (e.g. GDPR)
  
  * Limited access and control

* Technical

  * requires a lot of computing power $O(n)$ vs $O(n^2)$
  
  * complexity: format, inconsistencies (variable names, variables, coverage)

* Practical

  * documentation
  
  * Language: Data, documentation, experts

* Quality

  * *Total survey error framework*
  
      * Measurement
      
      * Representation

# Handling of big data, classic administrative register data


1. Discovery: Learn about the data

2. Structuring: Bring it in a format ready for analysis

3. Cleaning: Edit variables, create new variables, etc.

4. Enriching: Combine with other data soucres

5. Validating: Did the previous steps work as planned?

6. Analysis: Run your analysis


### Example: US birth statistics

First, we are downloading the birth data for the year 1990 form the website (NBER)[https://data.nber.org/natality/]. The data comes as a zip-file.

```{r download-data, eval = FALSE}
# Where is the data?
url <- "https://data.nber.org/natality/1990/natl1990.csv.zip"

# Where to save it?
zipfile <- "C:/users/Lenovo/Tmp/natl1990.csv.zip"

# Download
if(!exists(zipfile)){
GET(url, write_disk(zipfile, overwrite = TRUE)) #, progress() 
}

# Check size: file size in bytes
file.size(zipfile)

```


In the next step, we want to unzip the data. We use the two packages. We use `fread` from the `data.table` package, which does lazy-loading. This means that the data does not get loaded completely into the memory. 

```{r load-data, eval = FALSE}
# Load the data
command <- "unzip -cq"
cmdzip <- paste(command, zipfile)
dat <- fread(cmd=cmdzip)
```


In the next step, we look at the age distribution of mothers and fathers.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Age distribution
dat[ , .N, by = dmage]
dat[ , .N, by = dfage]


```


Apparently, there are many missing values for the age of father. We use the average age gap between mothers and fathers to impute the missing age of father.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Make father's age missing
dat$dfage <- ifelse(dat$dfage == 99, NA, dat$dfage)

# Estimate the average age distribution of mothers
dat[, age_diff := dmage - dfage]

# Impute 
dat$dfage <- ifelse(is.na(dat$dfage), dat$dmage - 3, dat$dfage)

```


Another issue with the data is that it evals births which occur to women who are not residing the United States.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Tabulate
dat[ , .N, by = restatus]

# Remove foreign living births
d <- d[restatus != 4, ]

```


In the next step, we can aggregate the data by age.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Using age specific birth counts
mothers <- dat[ .N, by = dmage]
fathers <- dat[ .N, by = dfage]

```


# Complex administrative register data

Question: Whether being in employment or not-employed affects the probability of childbirth.

We are particularly interested in first births.


First, we load the data.

```{r}
# Load the data 
files <- list.files("Data", pattern = "csv$")
names <- str_remove(files, ".csv") 

# Load the files
for(i in seq_along(files)){
  tmp <- fread(paste0("Data/", files[i]))
  assign(names[i], tmp)
}

```


We estimate exposures based on **the population registers**. Then, we add information about `employment` and `parity`.
To do that, we first look at the population files. We look at the data.  


```{r population-register}
# Status
reg_status$Year %>% tab
reg_status$Status %>% tab
reg_status$Gender %>% tab
reg_status$ID %>% unique %>% length
reg_status %>% filter(ID == 4) %>%  view


```


How to define the risk population. People at risk are people in the age range between age 15 and 55.


```{r}
# Create age
reg_status$Age <- reg_status$Year - reg_status$Cohort

# Validate
reg_status$Age %>% tab

# Drop persons above age 50 and who are above 15
exp <- reg_status %>% filter(Age %in% 15:50)

```

Check the status variable, which contains missing values. Create a flag-variable, which is 1 for people.

```{r}
# Create flag
reg_status <- reg_status %>% group_by(ID) %>% mutate(check = any(is.na(Status)))


# How many individuals have a missing
reg_status %>% filter(check) %>% pull(ID) %>% unique %>% length

```



The following code inserts a row into the population data, that was absent. This caused issues when merging the data.

```{r}
# Create a new row
additional_row <- reg_status %>% filter(ID == 4 & Year == 2004)
additional_row$Year <- 2003

# Bind rows
reg_status <- rbind(reg_status, additional_row)

# Arrange the data
reg_status <- reg_status %>% arrange(ID, Year)

```

### Births file

There is on issue with the birth data, because there are missing information on the ID of the parent.

```{r}
# Look at the data
tibble(births)

# Are there missing values
summary(births)

```


Moreover, there are birth information before the year of the population data.

```{r}
# Yeaer distribution
births$Year %>% tab

```


What are the parities.

```{r}
# Look at the parities
births %>% group_by(Father) %>% count() %>% pander()
births %>% group_by(Mother) %>% count() %>% pander()
```

```{r}
# Pivot longer
births_long <- births %>% pivot_longer(cols = c(Mother, Father), names_to = "Sex", values_to = "ID")

# Different version
mothers <- births %>% select(Mother, Year) %>%  rename(ID = Mother)
fathers <- births %>% select(Father, Year) %>% rename(ID = Father)

# Assign to each
mothers$FNR <- 0
fathers$FNR <- 1:dim(fathers)[1]

# Bind the rows
birthstmp <- rbind(mothers, fathers)

# Add the birth count variable
birthstmp$Birth <- 1


# Combine with the register data
reg_status <- left_join(reg_status, birthstmp)

#
reg_status %>% group_by(ID) %>% pull(Year) %>% diff
```

*Always check individual data!!!* For instance, when merging two data files, look at individual cases, and check whether the events are translated. Than, count the number of events and compare the event-file with the exposure file. 



The problem is that a birth can be related to several persons. The reason is that in birth file are different ID-values than in the population registers

```{r}
# Reg status
reg_status %>% filter(Gender == 1) %>%  pull(Birth) %>% sum(na.rm = T)
reg_status %>% filter(Gender == 2) %>%  pull(Birth) %>% sum(na.rm = T)

# Event file
births %>% filter(Year %in% 1990:2020 & !is.na(Mother) & Mother %in% reg_status$ID) %>% select(Mother) %>% count()
births %>% filter(Year %in% 1990:2020 & !is.na(Father) & Father %in% reg_status$ID) %>% select(Father) %>% count()

```

Apparently, one respondent (ID = 4) has a missing spell in the population data. We can insert a new variable



### Estimate the parity and employment status

```{r}


```
