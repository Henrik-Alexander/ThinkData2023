# My experience with ARD

- Birth register data from many countries

- Social security register data from Spain, Italy, US

- Health register data from Scotland

- Matched survey and social security register data from Germany

- Combined data from several registers for Norway  

# Course schedule

9:30-11:30 Introduction

13:00-14:30 Handling of big data, classic ARD

15:00-16:30 Complex ARD

# What is ARD?

- "Administrative" = Derived from administrative system

- "Register" = Covers full target population

- "Data" = Quantitative, rectangular data

# Examples of ARD

- Population registers
- Birth registers, death registers
- Migration registers
- Tax registers
- Social security registers
- Student registers
- Health registers 
- Company/establishment register
- Housing/building registers
- Vehicle licensing

# Benefits of ARD

- Often large, not just a sample

- Good coverage: Participation is compulsory/legally required and/or highly incentivized

- Often high data quality with no (or very few) missing values

# ARD in demographic research

- ARD has a very long history in demography

- "Classic" demography often used ARD...

- ... but mostly restricted to vital registration data

# ARD in social science research (1)

- ARD is a (mostly) recent development in (social science) research

- According to Google Scholar: 1,200 publications in 1990-94 with 'register data'...

- ... while in 2015-2019 there were 16,900 publications

# ARD in social science research (2)

Why did ARD only become popular recently?

- Availability (digitization)

- Supply and demand 

- Computational power

# What makes ARD special?

- Found data: Not collected for research purposes

- Found data: Often messy, fragmented, semi-systematic

- Big data: May be large and complex

# Challenges of ARD

- Ethical: Informed consent

- Legal: Difficult access

- Technical: Data size/complexity 

- Practical: Missing documentation

- Analytic: Limited variables/measurement 

- Quality: Data quality
